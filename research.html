      <h3>What is sustainability?</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>
        <li>In general, it means to be at a level of stability. But more specifically, we want to discuss how we can protect our environment enough to reach a certain sustainability level.</li> 
        <li>We've created this website to inform you of ways that we all can help our environment. After reading through this and playing our game, we hope it will help you remember at least one way to help.</li>
      </p>

      <h3>What is our current level at right now?</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>
        <li>The sustainability level can be challenging to pinpoint because the environment has so many variables that we must take into account.</li>
        <li>For instance, </li>
        <ol>
          <li><h5>Climate Change:</h5></li>
          <p> Climate change is a factor we all know of, but how does it affect our stability? Well, it does because it increases the water level. And with the increase of water level comes the decrease of glaciers. Which makes Earth have less reflective surfaces to protect itself against the sun.</p>
          <li><h5>Food waste:</h5></li>
          <p> The world wastes so much food it is insane! About 1.3 billion tons of food gets wasted. Meaning the energy, time, and resources it took to make that amount of food is also wasted. This leads to an increase in energy waste which affects the environment through pollution.</p>
          <li><h5>Types of Pollution:</h5></li>
          <p> Speaking of pollution, they're many types of pollution that change the levelâ€”air pollution, water pollution, plastic pollution, to name a few. But every single type of pollution causes harm to the Earth. Air pollution increases carbon dioxide emissions, Water pollution increases energy consumption( with the amount of energy we use to clean the water), and Platic pollution harms wildlife needed to maintain a healthy ecosystem.</p>
          <li><h5>Deforestation:</h5></li>
          <p> Trees are so important because they remove carbon from the air, but they are cut down endlessly!! Every second, about 8 feet worth of trees are cut down, meaning every minute, about 500 feet worth of trees are cut!</p>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <h3>What can we do to keep sustainability at this level during this Pandemic?</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>
        <table class="table">
          <tr>
            <th>If you do have Covid</th>
            <th>If you do not have Covid</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Do not recycle</td>
            <td>Keep plastic bags, masks, wipes, and latex gloves out of the recycling bin</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Try using washable masks to reduce mdeical waste</td>
            <td>Break down cardboard boxes and put them in the recycling bin whenever possible.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Stay safe and at Home!</td>
            <td>Donate and Recycle! Do not throw waste if not need to</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>research and vote for change!</td>
            <td>Pick up trash or recyclables! It may seems tiny but it helps!!</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </p>
      <h3>Can we improve this level?</h3>
      <hr>
      <li>Use green/public transport(gas cars are out!)</li>
      <li>Try to use reusable energy or reduce energy consumption</li>
      <li>learn about/donate eco-bricks(<a href="https://www.ecobricks.org/">ecobricks.org</a>)</li>
      <li>Go paperless!(we all use computers or phones!)</li>
      <li>Try Planting plants!(Any will help! Don't feel like you need to plant a tree)</li>
